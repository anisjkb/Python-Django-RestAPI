Function Based Views & URLs Creation for multiple Apps in Django

For multiple Apps we can create Views & URLs by Two Ways

1. Rename view's as diferent name insted of View's name by using this name
 URL's can easylly identified which function is calling by which View's.

2. Way-2: We can not import View's insted of directely inport function than run our project by using function

These method have a problem- need to have import lots of View's and function which is not best way

## Best Approach for Handling Views and URLs in Django for Multiple Apps

### 1. Project and App Setup
Start by creating your Django project and individual apps for your use case.

```bash
django-admin startproject myproject
cd myproject
django-admin startapp app1
django-admin startapp app2
```
You will now have a project folder (myproject) and two app folders (app1, app2).

### 2. Define Views for Each App
For each app, define function-based views (FBVs) in their respective `views.py`.

#### Example: `app1/views.py`
```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def home_view(request):
    return HttpResponse("Welcome to App 1 Home")

def about_view(request):
    return HttpResponse("About App 1")
```

#### Example: `app2/views.py`
```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def home_view(request):
    return HttpResponse("Welcome to App 2 Home")

def contact_view(request):
    return HttpResponse("Contact App 2")
```

### 3. Create URLs for Each App
Each app should have its own `urls.py` to manage its URL patterns independently. If an app does not have a `urls.py` file, create one.

#### Example: `app1/urls.py`
```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home_view, name='app1-home'),
    path('about/', views.about_view, name='app1-about'),
]
```

#### Example: `app2/urls.py`
```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home_view, name='app2-home'),
    path('contact/', views.contact_view, name='app2-contact'),
]
```

### 4. Hook App URLs into the Project URL Configuration
The project's `urls.py` acts as the central router and includes each app's URL patterns using the `include()` function.

#### Example: `myproject/urls.py`
```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('app1/', include('app1.urls')),  # Include app1's URLs
    path('app2/', include('app2.urls')),  # Include app2's URLs
]
```
Here, the `app1` URLs will be accessible at `/app1/` and the `app2` URLs at `/app2/`.

### 5. Testing the Configuration
Run the server to verify your setup:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
Navigate to:

- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/app1/` → Displays: "Welcome to App 1 Home"
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/app1/about/` → Displays: "About App 1"
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/app2/` → Displays: "Welcome to App 2 Home"
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/app2/contact/` → Displays: "Contact App 2"

### Why This Approach Works Well
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each app manages its own views and URL patterns, making the project modular.
- **Scalability**: New apps can easily be added and integrated into the project without cluttering the central `urls.py`.
- **Readability**: Clear organization of views and URLs improves maintainability.
