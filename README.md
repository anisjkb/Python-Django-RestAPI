# Django Overview

Django is a Python web framework that lets you quickly develop secure, maintainable websites. It includes a collection of libraries for both frontend and backend development.

# History Of Django

Django originated in 2003, developed by Python programmers Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison while they were employed at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper. They made the framework publicly available in 2005, releasing it under a BSD license. This type of license allows free usage of the software, with only minimal restrictions regarding its distribution and use.

## What is Django?

Django is a web application framework written in Python programming language. Django helps eliminate repetitive tasks, making the development process an easy and time-saving experience.

## Django’s Key Features:

- **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping):** ORM is a Django feature that makes interaction with databases a Python-based object manipulation exercise. The abstraction of SQL queries simplifies database administration and speeds up transitions from one database system to another.

- **Administrator Interface:** Django’s automatic admin interface is a hallmark of convenience. The Django admin interface allows developers to easily manage application data and perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

- **URL Routing:** Django’s expertise in URL routing supports well-structured, coherent URL schemes. This allows for the management of different views and endpoints within an application.

- **Safety:** Security is important to Django. The Django framework incorporates security measures that help protect against common web vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), or Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

- **Authorization and Authentication:** Django has a powerful authentication system with built-in features for managing users, controlling access, and assigning permissions.

- **Template Engine:** Template-engine integration streamlines the rendering of dynamic HTML content. This separates code from presentation and improves code maintainability.

- **Scalability:** Due to Django’s scalable architecture, it can scale from small projects to enterprise-grade applications.

## Why and When Should You Use Django?

Django is a good choice for developing web applications in these cases:

- Developing and designing an API Backend or web App Backend.
- Rapid development, which may be suitable for some web apps.
- Rapid deployment and scaling up to meet the requirements of an application.
- Utilizing an ORM specifically designed for databases rather than writing raw queries to manage them efficiently.
- Creating a secure single-page application to retrieve or post data.
